@brief Create signed distance field
@param input        Input texture
@param output       Output texture
@param rectangle    Rectangle in output texture where to render
@param radius       Max lookup radius in input texture
@param imageSize    Input texture size. Needed only in OpenGL ES, in desktop
    OpenGL the information is gathered automatically using
    @ref Texture2D::imageSize().

Converts binary image (stored in red channel of @p input) to signed distance
field (stored in red channel in @p rectangle of @p output). The purpose of this
function is to convert high-resolution binary image (such as vector artwork or
font glyphs) to low-resolution grayscale image. The image will then occupy much
less memory and can be scaled without aliasing issues. Additionally it provides
foundation for features like outlining, glow or drop shadow essentially for
free.

You can also use the @ref magnum-distancefieldconverter "magnum-distancefieldconverter"
utility to do distance field conversion on command-line. By extension, this
functionality is also provided through @ref magnum-fontconverter "magnum-fontconverter"
utility.

### The algorithm

For each pixel inside @p rectangle the algorithm looks at corresponding pixel in
@p input and tries to find nearest pixel of opposite color in area given by
@p radius. Signed distance between the points is then saved as value of given
pixel in @p output. Value of 1.0 means that the pixel was originally colored
white and nearest black pixel is farther than @p radius, value of 0.0 means
that the pixel was originally black and nearest white pixel is farther than
@p radius. Values around 0.5 are around edges.

The resulting texture can be used with bilinear filtering. It can be converted
back to binary form in shader using e.g. GLSL @glsl smoothstep() @ce function
with step around 0.5 to create antialiased edges. Or you can exploit the
distance field features to create many other effects. See also
@ref Shaders::DistanceFieldVector.

@attention This is GPU-only implementation, so it expects active context.

@note If internal format of @p output texture is not renderable, this function
    prints message to error output and does nothing. In desktop OpenGL and
    OpenGL ES 3.0 it's common to render to @ref TextureFormat::R8. In OpenGL ES
    2.0 you can use @ref TextureFormat::Red if @extension{EXT,texture_rg} is
    available, if not, the smallest but still inefficient supported format is
    in most cases @ref TextureFormat::RGB, rendering to @ref TextureFormat::Luminance
    is not supported in most cases.

@bug ES (and maybe GL < 3.20) implementation behaves slightly different
    (jaggies, visible e.g. when rendering outlined fonts)
