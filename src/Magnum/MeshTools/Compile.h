@brief Compile 2D mesh data

Configures mesh for @ref Shaders::Generic2D shader with vertex buffer and
possibly also index buffer, if the mesh is indexed. Positions are bound to
@ref Shaders::Generic2D::Position attribute. If the mesh contains texture
coordinates, they are bound to @ref Shaders::Generic2D::TextureCoordinates
attribute. No data compression or index optimization (except for index buffer
packing) is done. The @p usage parameter is used for both vertex and index
buffer.

The second returned buffer may be @cpp nullptr @ce if the mesh is not indexed.

This is just a convenience function for creating generic meshes, you might want
to use @ref interleave() and @ref compressIndices() functions instead for
greater flexibility.
