Contains classes for interacting with OpenGL.

All of this library except @ref OpenGLTester is built as part of Magnum by
default. To use this library with CMake, you need to request the `Magnum`
package and link to the `Magnum::Magnum` target:

@code{.cmake}
find_package(Magnum REQUIRED)

need to request given `*Application` component of the `Magnum` package and link
to the `Magnum::Application` target. Example using the @ref Platform::Sdl2Application
library:

@code{.cmake}
find_package(Magnum REQUIRED Sdl2Application)
